Technologies Used: Java, JSP, Servlets, JDBC, Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, HTML, CSS

The Cake Shop Management System is a Java-based web application designed to streamline cake inventory and employee management for a bakery business. The system includes a secure login module for both Admin and Employees, with role-based access control.

Key Features:
Admin & Employee Login:
Admin and employees can log in using unique usernames and passwords. Access is restricted based on user roles.
Admin-Only Access:
Only the admin has the authority to manage employees—add, update, view, and delete employee records.
Cake Management:
Both admin and employees can add new cakes, update cake details (like name, price, and availability), view all cakes, and delete cake records.
Backend Integration:
JDBC is used to connect Java with the Oracle SQL database. All data is stored securely and managed using PL/SQL.
Frontend Design:
HTML and CSS are used for creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces. JSP is used for dynamic pages, and Servlets handle backend logic and routing.
